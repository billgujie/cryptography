Files:
	hw4.c.........contains main()
	crypt.c.......crypt/decrypt file with key
	histo.c.......histogram for a specfic index
	invkey.c......generate inverse key
	keygen.c......generate 'random' key file
	solve.c.......cryptanalysis report
	util.c........contains utility functions called by
					other functions frequently
	cmdread.c.....called by main() to process arguments
	hw4.h.........cmdread return struct defined, and
					all constants used by other functions
					
	and:
					
	mystery1.invkeys
	mystery2.invkeys
	

Cryptanalysis Report:
	mystery1.ct:
					run following command:
					./hw4 solve -l=10 mystery1.ct
					showing two spikes in auto-correlation: t=5 and t=10, 
					then period of 5 is confirmed running histo -t=5 
					showing most unevenly distributed percentages.
					
					first key file was constructed using the initial histogram
					result, then observation started with m'kl mapped to i've.
	
	mystery2.ct:	
					run following command:
					./hw4 solve -l=10 mystery2.ct
					does not show significant evidence of period
					then increase max_t to 20:
					./hw4 solve -l=20 mystery2.ct
					showing spike in t=11, and period of 11 was confirmed 
					running histo -t=11 showed significant different percentage
					distributions than other period.
					
					first key file was constructed using the initial histogram
					then observation was made on:
