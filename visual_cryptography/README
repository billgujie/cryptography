HW2:					stream, encrypt, merge, decrypt
Author:				Jie Gu
Last Modified:		2/11/2014

Files:
	hw2.c.........contains main()
	stream.c......simple stream cipher
	encrypt.c.....encrypt pbm file into 2 shares, calls
					stream. (4x expansion version)
	merge.c.......merge two shares into 1 pbm file
	decrypt.c.....convert merged file into its
					orginal format
	util.c........contains utility functions called by
					other functions frequently
	cmdread.c.....called by main() to process arguments
	hw2.h.........cmdread return struct defined, and
					all constants used by other functions
	

Compile Instruction:
	1.	cd /source/folder/
	2.	make hw2

Known Bugs:
	decrypt function does not check file validity bit
	by bit, if the file is tampered the program may
	continue as the file is normal, and output the
	decrypted pbm file.
	
Compiled and tested under:
	Valgrind-3.7.0 produce no error/memory leak
	GCC 4.2.1
	GCC 4.6.3
